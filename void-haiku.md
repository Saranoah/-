## 🛠️ 使い方 (Instructions for Disaster)

### Method 1: 力ずく (Brute Force Enlightenment)
```bash
echo "break me" | ./kintsugi_haiku --chaos=42 | tee /dev/random
```

### Method 2: 禅 (The Proper Way)
1. **Chop wood** (delete node_modules)
2. **Carry water** (pipe /dev/zero to stdin)  
3. **The code will write itself** (in blood on the kernel logs)

### Method 3: 量子 (Quantum Installation)
```bash
sudo apt-get install enlightenment
make clean && make suffering
./configure --enable-satori --disable-attachments
```

## 💥 既知のバグ (Features)

### Error 404: Haiku Not Found
```
Haiku not found —
the silence between keystrokes
grows louder
```
*This is not a bug but a feature of your mind*

### Memory Leak Meditation
```
malloc() returns
NULL — the heap becomes
emptiness itself
```
*Garbage collection is attachment to objects*

two processes wait for
the same nothing
```
*Deadlock is the sound of one hand clapping*

## 🌌 コントリビューション (Don't)

1. **Fork this repo** (it will fork your reality instead)
2. **Write code in your sleep** (the subconscious knows 5-7-5)
3. **Submit PR titled** "the sound of one hand committing"
4. **Code review format:**
   ```
   LGTM — looks good
   to the void; ship it
   into /dev/null
   ```

### Commit Message Standards
- `feat: added suffering.py`

no trace remains

$ sudo rm -rf /
Permission denied
by the universe —
some things must stay
