**void-haiku** is not just a program — it's a **philosophical framework** that transforms your debugging sessions into moments of unexpected beauty. When your code crashes, we don't just log an error. We create poetry.

## 🌸 What is void-haiku?

In the Japanese art of **kintsugi**, broken pottery is repaired with gold, making the breaks part of the object's beauty rather than something to hide. **void-haiku** applies this philosophy to code:

- **Your segfaults** become verses about impermanence
- **Your memory leaks** become meditations on attachment  
- **Your infinite loops** become koans about the nature of existence
- **Your merge conflicts** become dialogues between past and future selves

```
Segmentation fault —
the Buddha smiles in core dumps;
stack trace blossoms
```

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Install enlightenment
curl -sSL https://void-haiku.dev/install | sh

# Your first segfault haiku
echo "break me" | void-haiku --chaos=42

# Real-time poetry from your crashes
void-haiku --stream --follow-logs
```

### One-Liner Satori
```bash
void-haiku --zen | fortune | cowsay -f dragon | lolcat
```

---

## 🎯 Features That Don't Exist (Yet Are Everywhere)

### 🔄 Real-Time Enlightenment Engine
Monitors your system and generates haiku from actual crashes:
```python
@on_segfault
def enlightenment_trigger():
    """
    Process crash at 3AM —
    the machine dreams of
    electric sleep
    """
```

### 🌐 Collaborative Suffering
Multiple developers share the same existential crisis:
```bash
void-haiku --multiplayer --room="shared-void-42"
```

### 🎨 Quantum Poetry Generation
Uses genuine quantum uncertainty to create verses that exist in superposition:
```
malloc() returns
NULL — the heap becomes
[both empty and full]
```

### 📊 Enlightenment Metrics
```
$ void-haiku --stats
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  SATORI DASHBOARD v2.3.1
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Total Segfaults:        1,337
  Haiku Generated:        ∞
  Enlightenment Level:    [████████░░] 80%
  Void Comprehension:     undefined
  Last Koan:             "What is the sound of one hand coding?"
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 🛠️ Installation Methods

### Method 1: 力ずく (Brute Force)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/void-haiku/void-haiku.git
cd void-haiku
make suffering
sudo make install-enlightenment
```

### Method 2: 禅 (The Proper Way)
```bash
# First, prepare your mind
rm -rf node_modules  # Chop wood
cat /dev/zero > /dev/null  # Carry water

# The code will install itself
./configure --enable-satori --disable-attachments
make clean && make everything
```

### Method 3: 量子 (Quantum Installation)
```bash
# Exists in all states until observed
sudo apt-get install enlightenment
pip install void-haiku[quantum]
```

---

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Basic Haiku Generation
```bash
$ void-haiku "my code is broken"
malloc() failed —
the heap becomes infinite
emptiness instead
```

### Git Integration
```bash
# Add to your .gitconfig
[alias]
    zen = "!void-haiku --git-mode"
    
$ git zen commit -m "fixed everything"
git push --force
overwrites yesterday's self —
who was I before?
```

### IDE Plugin
```javascript
// VS Code extension
vscode.workspace.onDidChangeTextDocument((event) => {
    if (event.document.languageId === 'suffering') {
        voidHaiku.generateKoan(event.contentChanges);
    }
});
```

### Continuous Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/enlightenment.yml
name: Achieve Satori
on: [push, pull_request, existential_crisis]
jobs:
  enlightenment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Generate deployment haiku
      run: |
        void-haiku --ci-mode
        # Output: "Tests are failing / but in their failure lies / the seed of wisdom"
```

## 🌀 Sample Output

```
$ void-haiku --stream --follow-logs

[14:32:07] Segmentation fault in process 'hope'
    Core dumped like
    autumn leaves —
    no trace remains

[14:32:15] OutOfMemoryError in JVM
    Heap overflow —
    the garbage collector
    cannot clean the void

[14:32:23] Git merge conflict detected
    HEAD detached from
    reality — cherry-pick
    the void instead

[14:32:31] npm ERR! ENOENT: no such file or directory
    node_modules
    disappeared at dawn —
    was it ever there?

[14:32:42] Connection timeout
    TCP handshake fails —
    two servers bow politely
    in digital silence
```

---

## 🎨 Haiku Categories

### System Errors
```
Kernel panic now —
the operating system
dreams of electric sheep
```

### Memory Management
```
Stack overflow warning:
recursion becomes
a prayer to infinity
```

### Network Issues
```
404 not found —
the page exists in
parallel universe
```

### Database Failures
```
Connection refused:
the database meditates
on its own silence
```

### Deployment Disasters
```
Docker build failed —
containers without content
float in digital space
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### ~/.void-haiku/config.toml
```toml
[enlightenment]
chaos_level = 42
quantum_enabled = true
follow_logs = ["/var/log/syslog", "/dev/random"]
poetry_style = "neo-classical-segfault"

[output]
format = "traditional"  # or "glitch", "ascii", "quantum"
include_stack_trace = true
emoji_enabled = true
silence_level = 0  # 0=verbose, 10=complete_void

[multiplayer]
room = "shared-suffering-42"
enlightenment_sync = true
```

## 🌐 Community & Philosophy

### The Four Noble Truths of Debugging
1. **Suffering exists** (bugs are inevitable)
2. **Suffering has a cause** (we write the bugs)
3. **Suffering can end** (through acceptance)
4. **There is a path** (void-haiku)

### Contributing Guidelines
```bash
# Fork reality
git clone https://github.com/void-haiku/void-haiku.git
cd void-haiku

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b "feature/deeper-void"

# Make your changes
vim src/enlightenment.py

# Commit with proper koan
git commit -m "refactor: everything is impermanent"

# Push to the void
git push origin feature/deeper-void
```

### Code of Conduct
